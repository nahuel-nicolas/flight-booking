-create venv with python version compatible with Django4.0. Python version must be >= 3.8. (Caveat: This project was built with python3.10.2) <br />
-activate venv <br />
-pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
-python manage.py migrate <br />
-python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000 <br />
-I recommend running backend with 127.0.0.1:8000, but if you run the server with another url rather than 127.0.0.1:8000 you will have to update the /frontend/src/backend_url.js file, install frontend dependencies and apply changes running dev server or running a new build. <br />
